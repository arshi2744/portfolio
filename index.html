            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. This is my first crack at web development, so I hope I'm off on the
            right foot! A little about myself &mdash; my name is Arshad, I'm 34 years old, grew up in a small town in
            Pakistan,  moved to United States in 2016, and have been living in Pennsylvania for the past 2 years. I have
            one brother and sister. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm excited to start this journey into the world of coding and web development to enhance my skills.My background in Project management, finance, Warehousing, and collections is particularly strong, having earned a bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics and Statistics, as well as an MBA Human resource management.
         Did i mentioned that I am a full stack developer with experience building in Javascript, React, Mongo, SQL, Express and Node? I believe the intersection of technology and Project management is a sweet spot for significant disruption in the future.
            
        </p>

        <p>
            At the top of this page, you'll find a link to my portfolio, as well as an option to contact me with any
            questions, comments, or feedback! Clicking on my name, or the <strong>About</strong> link, will always
            bring you back to this page. At the bottom, you will find my email, and links to my LinkedIn and GitHub
            pages. I hope you enjoy my first website, and many more to come!
        </p>
